        Low Porosity hair has trouble maintaining moisture. When washing hair, be sure to use warm water to open up the cuticles, 
        pro tip: use heat in the form of plastic cap/steamer/deep conditioning cap when deep conditioning for best results. 
        Hydrating products including humectants, penetrating ingredients, and light oils are what you should look out for.
        Lighter products are best to use as they are easier to absorb and will avoid the potential for build up.

        High porosity hair has issue with moisture leaving it too quickly. It is able to easily and immediately accept moisture but this 
        does not last. To combat this it is best to use conditioners with ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil to provide intense hydration. 
        As hydration is key for high porosity hair, protein treatments, which cause the hair to strengthen, may cause a sensitivity issue to some. 
        Along with this since moisture leaves quickly, it is important to keep high porosity hair well hydrated, regularly seal in moisture to prevent dryness.
